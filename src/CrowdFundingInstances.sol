Create a smart contract in which you can create new 'crowdfunding instances',

Why the need for decentralised crowdfunding primitive?

This contract could be reused and become a DeFi primitive - e.g. a ICO could use it to determine
how to distribute tokens in a verifiable manner, without having to deploy their own crowdfunding contract.

There would be no manager of this contract, it would be completely permissionless.
