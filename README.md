## Crowd Funder Instantiator

## make an anon medium article for this and make it 'popular' so that i can mix with more people.

**This is a permissionless smart contract which allows crowd funding 'campaings' to be instantiated and donated to.**

### I noticed that there are lots of crowd funding smart contract projects. So I made my own for fun, but I also noticed that the 'real deal' projects often had some sort of management team or token or some sort of KYC/login, or had a lengthy justification for their project. And I thought, I just want to see something that is permissionless and simple and just there to use. So here it is. Have at it. **

- **Ethereum Mainnet Address**
```shell
$ 0xethmainnetaddy
```
- **Arbitrum One Address**
```shell
$ 0xarbitrumAddy
```


### Feel free to deploy this on other EVM compatible chains. **
### I have also developed a TUI which allows you to interact with any of these contracts, just by specifying the chain, rpc and contract address. The TUI as it stands takes a 0.3% fee on any transactions. This of course can be mitigated by developing your own interface. Or don't, if you want to support me ;) **

### At some point I will integrate this with the Railgun ZK system for privacy. Privacy is a human right.
### You can support me by donating to this address: 0xmyaddy (Ethereum + L2s)
### You can also support me by building your own permissionless, fault-tolerant economic infrastructure O_O

## The contract allows users to:

-   **create a campaign**,
-   **delete a campaign**,
-   **contribute to a campaign**,
-   **create a campaign**,
-   **claim a refund from a campaign if it is unsuccessful**,
-   **get the details of a campaign including refundable amounts**.
